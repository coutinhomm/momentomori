# 🕯️ Momento Mori

**"Remember that you will die."**

[https://momentomori.coutinhomm.me](https://momentomori.coutinhomm.me) — a minimalistic and existential visualization of your time on Earth.  
Each square represents one week of your life. The filled ones are gone. The rest? Borrowed.

## ✨ About

**Momento Mori** is a personal project meant to confront you with the finite nature of your time.

Inspired by the book *Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals* by Oliver Burkeman, it displays your lifespan — not as a to-do list, but as a ticking countdown.

- Total squares: 4,000 (approx. 76 years)  
- Lived weeks: `#FF6E98`  
- Remaining weeks: `#FFF348`  
- No buttons. No distractions. Just reality.
